This is a front-end mentor challenge that I took to test my knowledge and application of the web programming languages: HTMl and CSS. The Test was to design a qr-based component.

### What I learned

I learned how to design a card cause the task was to design a qr-component card.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h6 class="i-text">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h6>
```

```css
[alt="This is an image of a bar-code scanner"] {
  width: 100%;
  border-radius: 20px;
}
```

### Continued development

I really to work on how to design different projects with ease using html, css and vanilla js before I start using different frameworks to build my projects.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/yU-euUrE3Bg?si=hln8i2IbZA4NIF33) - This helped me an overview of how to style a card component. I liked the pattern and will use it going forward.
